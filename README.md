  # SVG Logo Generator
  

  ## Project Description
  
  The goal of this project is to create a back-end program that allows the user to quickly create logos for various applications. The logo will be a 300px x 200px svg file that contains up to 3 letters in the color of the users choice and their choice from a list of shapes. This solves the problem of freelance developers having to pay graphic designers to generate simple logos. I learned how to implement testing and deepened my understanding of Inquirer.
